  "explanation": "Tioga Road is currently closed as of June 1, 2023, but plows are nearing Yosemite Creek. Tioga Road typically opens to vehicles in late May or June, and there is no way to provide a more precise estimate for this year due to the record snowpack. However, plowing typically begins around April 15, so it is expected to open soon."
